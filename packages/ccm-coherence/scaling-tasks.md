# CCM Coherence Scaling Tasks

This document tracks the tasks needed to extend ccm-coherence to support arbitrary dimensions, enabling applications like BJC codec to work with inputs up to 4096 bits and beyond.

## Overview

The ccm-coherence package currently has good support for small dimensions (≤ 64) but needs extensions to handle arbitrary dimensions efficiently. The existing infrastructure (BigIndex, SingleBlade, ScalableAlgebra) provides a foundation, but key operations need to be completed for full scalability.

## High Priority Tasks

### 1. Sparse Element with BigIndex Support
**Status**: Completed ✅  
**Description**: Extend sparse element storage to support components at indices beyond 64-bit addressing.

**Requirements**:
- Current `SparseCliffordElement` uses `usize` indices, limiting it to 2^64 components
- Need support for arbitrary dimension indices using `BigIndex`
- Maintain efficient storage and lookup for sparse patterns

**Approach**:
- Option 1: Extend `SparseCliffordElement` to use `BigIndex` internally
- Option 2: Create new `SparseBigElement` type specifically for large dimensions
- Implement efficient component storage (e.g., BTreeMap<BigIndex, Complex<P>>)

### 2. Coherence Norm for Scalable Types
**Status**: Completed ✅  
**Description**: Implement coherence norm computation for scalable types without materialization.

**Requirements**:
- Coherence norm for `SingleBlade`: ||blade||_c = |coefficient|
- Coherence norm for `SparseBigElement`: Σ|components|²
- Must respect grade-orthogonal structure (Axiom A1)

**Implementation**:
```rust
impl<P: Float> SingleBlade<P> {
    pub fn coherence_norm(&self) -> P {
        self.coefficient.norm()
    }
}
```

### 3. BigIndex Arithmetic Operations
**Status**: Completed ✅  
**Description**: Complete arithmetic operations on BigIndex for geometric products.

**Requirements**:
- AND operation: index intersection for shared basis vectors
- OR operation: index union for combined basis vectors  
- Efficient bit counting for grade computation
- Sign computation for basis vector reordering

**Key Operations**:
- `BigIndex::and(&self, other: &BigIndex) -> BigIndex`
- `BigIndex::or(&self, other: &BigIndex) -> BigIndex`
- `BigIndex::compute_sign(idx1: &BigIndex, idx2: &BigIndex) -> i32`

## Medium Priority Tasks

## Success Criteria

The implementation is complete when:

1. **Arbitrary Dimension Support**: Can create and manipulate Clifford algebras of any dimension limited only by available memory
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Operations use memory proportional to sparsity, not dimension
3. **Correctness**: All mathematical properties (grade-orthogonality, associativity, etc.) hold
4. **Performance**: Operations complete in reasonable time for dimensions up to 4096
5. **API Consistency**: Same interface works for dimensions 3 to 4096+

## Implementation Order

1. Start with BigIndex arithmetic operations (foundation for everything else)
2. Implement SparseBigElement or extend SparseCliffordElement
3. Add coherence norm for scalable types
4. Complete streaming operations
5. Implement geometric product for sparse elements
6. Extend grade iteration
7. Update unified API
8. Comprehensive testing

## Notes

- The existing `ScalableAlgebra` and `SingleBlade` types provide a good foundation
- Focus on maintaining mathematical correctness while enabling scale
- Prioritize memory efficiency over computation speed for large dimensions
- Ensure all implementations respect CCM Axiom A1 (coherence inner product)
