## Completion Criteria

The ccm-symmetry package will be considered complete when:

3. The ccm package can use all symmetry features without errors
4. All tests pass with >90% coverage
5. Documentation is complete for all public APIs

## Priority Order

1. Fix Critical Tasks (1-2) - Required for basic functionality
2. Complete High Priority Tasks (3-4) - Core mathematical features
3. Address Medium Priority Tasks (5-7) - Extended functionality
4. Consider Low Priority Tasks (8-10) - Based on user needs
5. Ensure comprehensive testing and documentation
6. Optimize performance for production use

## Notes

- Focus on completing features actually used by ccm and potential COC integration
- Complex modules should be implemented in a subdirectory with sub-modules to keep package organized.
