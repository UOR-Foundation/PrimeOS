# Automorphisms of ℤ/48ℤ × ℤ/256ℤ

This file characterizes the automorphism group of G = ℤ/48ℤ × ℤ/256ℤ.

## Main Results

- `aut_order`: |Aut(G)| = 2048 = 2^11
- `aut_diagonal_form`: All automorphisms have the form φ(x,y) = (ax mod 48, dy mod 256)
- `units_48_order`: |U(48)| = 16
- `units_256_order`: |U(256)| = 128
- `aut_factorization`: 2048 = φ(48) × φ(256)

## Key Facts

- U(n) is the group of units modulo n (elements coprime to n)
- Aut(ℤ/nℤ × ℤ/mℤ) ≅ U(n) × U(m) when gcd(n,m) = 1
- φ(48) = φ(16) × φ(3) = 8 × 2 = 16
- φ(256) = 256 × (1 - 1/2) = 128
- Every automorphism is determined by where it sends the generators (1,0) and (0,1)
