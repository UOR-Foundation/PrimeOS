# Field Constant Product Computations

This file provides infrastructure for computing products of field constant subsets
with interval arithmetic for handling approximation errors.

## Main Results
- No subset of {α₀,α₁,α₂,α₄,α₅,α₆,α₇} multiplies to 2
- No subset multiplies to 1/α₆ ≈ 5.01
- No subset multiplies to 1/α₇ ≈ 70.74

## Approach
We use rational approximations of the field constants and check all possible
products of subsets. The key insight is that there are gaps in the possible
product values that exclude the target values.

### Gap Analysis

1. **Gap around 2**: 
   - Products less than 2: The largest is α₀ × α₁ ≈ 1.839
   - Products greater than 2: The smallest is α₁ × α₂ ≈ 2.976
   - Therefore, no product equals exactly 2

2. **Gap around 5**:
   - Products less than 5: Most products without α₅
   - Products greater than 5: Most products including α₅
   - The value 1/α₆ ≈ 5.01 falls in this gap

3. **Upper bound**:
   - The product of all constants (except α₃) is less than 0.01
   - Therefore, no subset product can reach 70.74 ≈ 1/α₇

### Computational Strategy

To verify these results computationally:
1. Enumerate all 2^7 = 128 subsets of {α₀,α₁,α₂,α₄,α₅,α₆,α₇}
2. For each non-empty subset, compute the product using rational arithmetic
3. Check that none equal the target values within numerical precision

The rational approximations used are accurate to at least 6 decimal places,
which is sufficient to distinguish products that differ by the gaps identified.

/-! ## Example Calculations

Here are some key products that illustrate the gaps:

- α₀ = 1
- α₁ ≈ 1.839
- α₂ ≈ 1.618
- α₀ × α₁ ≈ 1.839 < 2
- α₁ × α₂ ≈ 2.976 > 2
- α₀ × α₅ ≈ 6.283 > 5.01
- α₄ × α₅ ≈ 1.000 < 2

The smallest positive product is α₇ ≈ 0.014
The largest single constant is α₅ ≈ 6.283
