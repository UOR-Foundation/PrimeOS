/-- The exact sum constraint value -/
def sumConstraintValue : ℝ := 687.1101183515111

/-- The sum of resonances as a function of α₆ and α₇ -/
noncomputable def resonanceSumFunction (α₆ α₇ : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ n : Fin 12288, 
    let byte := (n.val / 256 : ℕ)

/-- The resonance sum is continuous in α₆ -/
theorem resonanceSum_continuous_α₆ (α₇ : ℝ) : 
    Continuous (fun α₆ => resonanceSumFunction α₆ α₇) := by
  -- The sum is continuous because:
  -- 1. It's a finite sum of continuous functions
  -- 2. Each term involves sin which is continuous
  -- 3. The composition of continuous functions is continuous
  sorry

/-- The resonance sum is continuous in α₇ -/
theorem resonanceSum_continuous_α₇ (α₆ : ℝ) : 
    Continuous (fun α₇ => resonanceSumFunction α₆ α₇) := by
  -- Similar reasoning as for α₆
  sorry

/-- The resonance sum is jointly continuous in α₆ and α₇ -/
theorem resonanceSum_continuous : 
    Continuous (fun p : ℝ × ℝ => resonanceSumFunction p.1 p.2) := by
  -- Follows from the individual continuity results
  sorry

/-- Different values of α₆ with fixed α₇ give different sums -/
theorem resonanceSum_injective_α₆ (α₇ : ℝ) (hα₇ : 0 < α₇ ∧ α₇ < 1) :
    ∀ α₆₁ α₆₂ : ℝ, 0 < α₆₁ → α₆₁ < 1 → 0 < α₆₂ → α₆₂ < 1 → α₆₁ ≠ α₆₂ →
    resonanceSumFunction α₆₁ α₇ ≠ resonanceSumFunction α₆₂ α₇ := by
  -- The sum changes with α₆ because:
  -- 1. The phase in the sin function depends on α₆
  -- 2. Different phases give different sums over the 12288 positions
  sorry

/-- Different values of α₇ with fixed α₆ give different sums -/
theorem resonanceSum_injective_α₇ (α₆ : ℝ) (hα₆ : 0 < α₆ ∧ α₆ < 1) :
    ∀ α₇₁ α₇₂ : ℝ, 0 < α₇₁ → α₇₁ < 1 → 0 < α₇₂ → α₇₂ < 1 → α₇₁ ≠ α₇₂ →
    resonanceSumFunction α₆ α₇₁ ≠ resonanceSumFunction α₆ α₇₂ := by
  -- Similar reasoning as for α₆
  sorry

/-- The level set where the sum equals the constraint value -/
def sumConstraintLevelSet : Set (ℝ × ℝ) :=
  {p : ℝ × ℝ | resonanceSumFunction p.1 p.2 = sumConstraintValue ∧ 
               0 < p.1 ∧ p.1 < 1 ∧ 0 < p.2 ∧ p.2 < 1}

/-- The sum constraint level set forms a curve (1-dimensional manifold) -/
theorem sumConstraint_is_curve :
    ∃ (f : ℝ → ℝ), Continuous f ∧ 
    ∀ α₆ ∈ Set.Ioo 0 1, (α₆, f α₆) ∈ sumConstraintLevelSet := by
  -- By the implicit function theorem:
  -- 1. The sum function is continuously differentiable
  -- 2. The partial derivative with respect to α₇ is non-zero
  -- 3. Therefore locally we can express α₇ as a function of α₆
  sorry

/-- The gradient of the sum function is non-zero on the constraint level set -/
theorem sumGradient_nonzero_on_levelSet :
    ∀ p ∈ sumConstraintLevelSet, 
    ∃ (∂₆ ∂₇ : ℝ), (∂₆, ∂₇) ≠ (0, 0) ∧
    ∂₆ = deriv (fun α₆ => resonanceSumFunction α₆ p.2) p.1 ∧
    ∂₇ = deriv (fun α₇ => resonanceSumFunction p.1 α₇) p.2 := by
  -- The gradient is non-zero because:
  -- 1. The sum function genuinely depends on both α₆ and α₇
  -- 2. At any point on the level set, at least one partial derivative is non-zero
  sorry

/-- The sum constraint is independent of the resonance count constraint -/
theorem sumConstraint_independent_of_count :
    ∃ (p₁ p₂ : ℝ × ℝ), 
    p₁ ∈ sumConstraintLevelSet ∧ 
    p₂ ∈ sumConstraintLevelSet ∧
    p₁ ≠ p₂ ∧
    -- Both give 96 unique resonance values
    (Finset.image (fun n => resonance n) Finset.univ).card = 96 := by
  -- The constraints are independent because:
  -- 1. The sum constraint forms a curve in (α₆, α₇) space
  -- 2. The count constraint also forms a curve
  -- 3. These curves are not identical (proven by showing different tangent directions)
  sorry

/-- The sum constraint together with the count constraint uniquely determines α₆ and α₇ -/
theorem sum_and_count_determine_system :
    ∃! (α₆ α₇ : ℝ), 
    (α₆, α₇) ∈ sumConstraintLevelSet ∧
    -- The system with these values has exactly 96 unique resonances
    (Finset.image (fun n => resonance n) Finset.univ).card = 96 ∧
    -- These are the specific values
    α₆ = 0.19961197478400415 ∧
    α₇ = 0.014134725141734695 := by
  -- Uniqueness follows from:
  -- 1. Both constraints define curves in (α₆, α₇) space
  -- 2. The curves intersect transversally (non-parallel tangents)
  -- 3. Therefore they intersect at exactly one point
  sorry

/-- The sum constraint value is achieved by the actual system -/
theorem actual_system_satisfies_sum :
    ∑ n : Fin 12288, resonance n = sumConstraintValue := by
  -- This connects to the proven result in Resonance.Sum
  exact resonance_sum_exact_value

/-- Helper: The sum varies monotonically along certain directions -/
theorem sum_monotonic_along_rays (α₆₀ α₇₀ : ℝ) (h₆ : 0 < α₆₀ ∧ α₆₀ < 1) (h₇ : 0 < α₇₀ ∧ α₇₀ < 1) :
    ∃ (v : ℝ × ℝ), v ≠ (0, 0) ∧ 
    StrictMono (fun t => resonanceSumFunction (α₆₀ + t * v.1) (α₇₀ + t * v.2)) := by
  -- There exists a direction in which the sum increases strictly
  -- This helps prove the level set is a proper curve
