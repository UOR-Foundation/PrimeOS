# The 96 Resonance Constraint

This file proves that the constraint of having exactly 96 unique resonance values
significantly restricts the possible values of α₆ and α₇, effectively determining
the system.

## Main Results

- `resonance_count_function`: The function mapping (α₆, α₇) to the number of unique resonances
- `resonance_count_sensitivity`: Changing α₆ or α₇ changes the resonance count
- `constraint_surface`: The constraint defines a curve/surface in (α₆, α₇) space
- `constraint_determines_system`: The 96-resonance constraint significantly restricts values
