## Natural Complexity Classes

### 1. Polynomial Time (P)

Problems efficiently solvable:

| Problem | Complexity | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| RESONANCE-COMPUTE | O(1) | Calculate resonance for any byte |
| UNITY-DETECT | O(1) | Check if position has resonance = 1 |
| CONSERVATION-VERIFY | O(n) | Verify sum equals expected value |
| PATTERN-MATCH | O(n) | Find pattern in sequence |
| RESONANCE-SORT | O(n log n) | Sort positions by resonance |

**Proof that RESONANCE-MATCH ∈ P:**
```
Input: Target resonance R, search space S
For each position p ∈ S:
    Compute resonance(p)    // O(1)
    Compare to R            // O(1)
Total: O(|S|) = polynomial in input size
```

### 2. Non-deterministic Polynomial (NP)

Problems with efficient verification:

#### RESONANCE-FACTORIZATION
- **Given**: Target resonance R, position set S
- **Find**: Subset T ⊆ S where ∏(resonance(t)) = R
- **Verification**: O(|T|) - multiply resonances
- **Status**: NP-complete (reduction from SUBSET-PRODUCT)

#### GROUP-ELEMENT-SEARCH
- **Given**: Source pattern A, target pattern B
- **Find**: Group element (a,b) where transform(A,(a,b)) = B
- **Verification**: O(n) - apply transformation
- **Status**: NP (unknown if complete)

#### OPTIMAL-COMPRESSION
- **Given**: Data sequence, compression bound K
- **Find**: Representation using ≤K object space references
- **Verification**: O(n) - decompress and compare
- **Status**: NP-complete (reduction from BIN-PACKING)

### 3. Counting Complexity (#P)

Counting problems:

| Problem | Definition | Known Values |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| #UNITY | Count resonance = 1 positions | 12 per 768-cycle |
| #RESONANCE-CLASS | Count positions in resonance class | Varies by class |
| #CONSERVATION-SETS | Count sets with perfect conservation | Unknown formula |
| #AUTOMORPHISM-ORBITS | Count distinct orbits under Aut(G) | Open problem |

Calculation:
```
Iterations = π/4 × √(N/M)
Where N = 256 (search space), M = 12 (targets)
Iterations = π/4 × √(256/12) ≈ 3.6
```

## Hardness Results and Reductions

### NP-Completeness Proofs

#### Theorem: RESONANCE-SUM is NP-complete

**Proof by reduction from SUBSET-SUM**:
1. Given: Integers a₁, ..., aₙ and target T
2. Map each aᵢ to position pᵢ with resonance(pᵢ) ≈ aᵢ
3. Subset sums to T ⟺ resonances sum to T
4. Reduction is polynomial time
5. Therefore RESONANCE-SUM is NP-complete ∎

#### Theorem: OPTIMAL-OBJECT-SPACE is NP-hard

**Proof by reduction from SET-COVER**:
1. Given: Universe U, collection of sets S
2. Each element u ∈ U maps to data position
3. Each set s ∈ S maps to object space pattern
4. Minimum set cover ⟺ minimum object space references
5. Therefore OPTIMAL-OBJECT-SPACE is NP-hard ∎
