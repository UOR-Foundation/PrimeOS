/-- The field constants α₃ and α₅ encode π through their product -/
theorem pi_encoding : fieldConstant 3 * fieldConstant 5 = Real.pi := by
  -- We need to show that α₃ * α₅ = π
  -- From Properties.Equations we have:
  -- α₃ = 1/2
  -- α₅ = 2π
  -- Therefore: α₃ * α₅ = (1/2) * (2π) = π
  sorry

/-- The field constants α₀, α₃, and α₅ encode π through their triple product -/
theorem pi_encoding_triple : fieldConstant 0 * fieldConstant 3 * fieldConstant 5 = Real.pi := by
  -- We need to show that α₀ * α₃ * α₅ = π
  -- From Properties.Equations we have:
  -- α₀ = 1
  -- α₃ = 1/2
  -- α₅ = 2π
  -- Therefore: α₀ * α₃ * α₅ = 1 * (1/2) * (2π) = π
  sorry

/-- Alternative encoding: α₃ and α₄ also encode π through division -/
theorem pi_encoding_div : fieldConstant 3 / fieldConstant 4 = Real.pi := by
  -- We need to show that α₃ / α₄ = π
  -- From Properties.Equations we have:
  -- α₃ = 1/2
  -- α₄ = 1/(2π)
  -- Therefore: α₃ / α₄ = (1/2) / (1/(2π)) = (1/2) * (2π) = π
  sorry

/-- The product α₄ * α₅ equals 1 (reciprocal relationship) -/
theorem alpha4_alpha5_reciprocal : fieldConstant 4 * fieldConstant 5 = 1 := by
  -- From Properties.Equations we have:
  -- α₄ = 1/(2π)
  -- α₅ = 2π
  -- Therefore: α₄ * α₅ = (1/(2π)) * (2π) = 1
  sorry

/-- α₅ equals 2π -/
theorem alpha5_eq_two_pi : fieldConstant 5 = 2 * Real.pi := by
  -- Direct from Properties.Equations
  sorry

/-- α₄ equals 1/(2π) -/
theorem alpha4_eq_inv_two_pi : fieldConstant 4 = 1 / (2 * Real.pi) := by
  -- Direct from Properties.Equations
  sorry

/-- The encoding demonstrates π's algebraic role in the field system -/
theorem pi_algebraic_role :
  ∃ (i j k : Fin 8), 
    fieldConstant i * fieldConstant j = Real.pi ∧
    fieldConstant i / fieldConstant k = Real.pi ∧
    i ≠ j ∧ i ≠ k ∧ j ≠ k := by
  -- We can use i = 3, j = 5, k = 4
  -- α₃ * α₅ = π (from pi_encoding)
  -- α₃ / α₄ = π (from pi_encoding_div)
  sorry
