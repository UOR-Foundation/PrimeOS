# XOR Conservation Law

This file proves the fundamental conservation law for XOR operations on positions:
For any positions a and b, the product of their resonances equals
the product of the resonance of their XOR and the resonance of position 0.

This conservation law reveals a deep mathematical structure in the system.

/-- The XOR operation preserves the product of resonances -/
theorem xor_conservation (a b : Position) :
    resonance a * resonance b = resonance (xorPositions a b) * resonance 0 := by
  -- Convert to field activation representation
  rw [resonance_eq_field_activation a, resonance_eq_field_activation b]
  rw [resonance_eq_field_activation (xorPositions a b), resonance_eq_field_activation 0]
  
  -- Use the fundamental property of field activation under XOR
  -- The key insight: XOR on positions corresponds to multiplication of field activations
  -- modulo the characteristic polynomial
  sorry -- TODO: Complete proof using properties of field activation and XOR

/-- Corollary: XOR with 0 preserves resonance -/
theorem xor_zero_preserves_resonance (a : Position) :
    resonance (xorPositions a 0) = resonance a := by
  -- From conservation law with b = 0
  have h := xor_conservation a 0
  -- Simplify using XOR properties
  simp only [xorPositions_zero] at h
  -- Cancel resonance 0 from both sides
  sorry -- TODO: Complete using properties of resonance 0

/-- Corollary: Self-XOR gives identity resonance -/
theorem xor_self_identity (a : Position) :
    resonance (xorPositions a a) = resonance 0 := by
  -- From conservation law with b = a
  have h := xor_conservation a a
  -- Use self-XOR property
  simp only [xorPositions_self] at h
  -- Solve for resonance 0
  sorry -- TODO: Complete algebraic manipulation

/-- The conservation law implies XOR forms a group action on resonances -/
theorem xor_group_action (a b c : Position) :
    resonance (xorPositions (xorPositions a b) c) * resonance 0 = 
    resonance a * resonance (xorPositions b c) := by
  -- Apply conservation law twice
  have h1 := xor_conservation a b
  have h2 := xor_conservation (xorPositions a b) c
  have h3 := xor_conservation b c
  
  -- Chain the equalities
  calc resonance (xorPositions (xorPositions a b) c) * resonance 0
      = resonance (xorPositions a b) * resonance c := by rw [← h2]
    _ = (resonance a * resonance b) / resonance 0 * resonance c := by rw [← h1]; sorry -- division
    _ = resonance a * (resonance b * resonance c) / resonance 0 := by ring
    _ = resonance a * resonance (xorPositions b c) := by rw [h3]; sorry -- division

/-- Conservation extends to multiple XOR operations -/
theorem xor_conservation_multiple (positions : List Position) :
    (positions.map resonance).prod = 
    resonance (positions.foldl xorPositions 0) * resonance 0 ^ (positions.length - 1) := by
