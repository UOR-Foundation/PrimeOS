# UOR Core Schemas

This directory contains schemas that define the Universal Object Reference (UOR) model. The UOR model provides a canonical, observer-invariant representation system based on prime decomposition.

## Directory Structure

Each subdirectory in the `schemas` directory contains a single schema at a specific depth level. Schema directories are organized with a flat structure—only one level deep under the `schemas` directory:

```
schemas/
├── core/                # Core UOR meta-schema (foundational concepts)
├── axioms/              # The eight core axioms of UOR
├── observer-frames/     # Observer reference frame definitions
├── prime-coordinates/   # Prime coordinate system schemas
├── coherence/           # Coherence metrics and measurements
├── representations/     # Canonical representation schemas
├── number-theory/       # Number theory domain and operations
├── algebra/             # Algebraic structures and operations
├── integration/         # Cross-domain integration mechanisms
├── transformations/     # Domain transformation operations
└── ...
```

**Important**: Schemas are organized with a flat directory structure—only one level deep under the `schemas` directory. This ensures clear separation between schema components while maintaining consistent access patterns.

## Core UOR Schema Components

### Core (core/)

The foundational meta-schema that defines the UOR model itself, including:

- Basic UOR types and objects

## Future Extensions

### Physics Domain (Needed Schemas)

To fully model physics using the UOR framework, the following schemas would need to be implemented:

1. **physics/spacetime-domain.json** - Define the spacetime manifold and its properties
2. **physics/quantum-field.json** - Define quantum field structure and operations

- Establish homomorphisms between cognitive and physical domains

## Schema Format

All schemas follow JSON Schema format with JSON-LD extensions for semantic web compatibility. Each schema contains:

1. Core type definitions
2. Property specifications
3. Relationship definitions
4. Validation rules
5. Semantic annotations

## Schema Dependencies

When schemas reference or depend on other schemas, these relationships are defined within the schema files themselves, not through directory nesting. This approach allows for:

1. Clear visualization of schema relationships
2. Easier maintenance and versioning
3. Consistent import paths
4. Prevention of circular dependencies

## Development Guidelines

When implementing new domain schemas, adhere to these principles:

1. **Domain Separation** - Each schema should model a single coherent domain without crossing domain boundaries
2. **Axiomatic Consistency** - All schemas must align with the eight core UOR axioms
3. **First Principles** - Start from irreducible elements and build complexity through composition
4. **No Overfitting** - Avoid creating schemas that are too specific to particular applications
5. **Explicit Boundaries** - Clearly define the boundaries of each schema's applicability
6. **Observer Frame Awareness** - Always account for the observer perspective in schema design
7. **Coherence Preservation** - Ensure transformations between domains preserve coherence
8. **Unique Factorization** - Maintain the property of unique factorization in all domains
